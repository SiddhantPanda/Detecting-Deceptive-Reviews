Detecting Deceptive Reviews using Natural Language Processing

The rising influence of user-generated online reviews has led to growing incentive for businesses to solicit and manufacture DECEPTIVE OPINION SPAM â€” fictitious reviews that have been deliberately written to sound authentic and deceive the reader.


In this project we'll distinguish between two kinds of deceptive opinion spam, depending on the sentiment expressed in the review i.e positive Deceptive and Negative Deceptive Review. We will build a viable solution which will help to pass a review and will give you back a label deciding whether the review is deceptive or Not.

This is one of the use cases in my NLP course from Supervised Learning E-Learning Platform.
